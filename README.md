# DirectX12 GameEngine
 A DirectX12 game engine made from scratch
 It was a school project that I'm updating at the moment because there are still a lot of memory leak and I need to make a refont of all the ECS

 # How to launch the application:
 - First go in the bin file, launch the make -open.bat and launch the solution named GameEngine.sln
 - Then you just have to start the debug in visual studio and the game will be displayed on your monitor
 - In the first menu of the game to start you can press S, move with ZQSD, Pause menu with Escape and exit Pause menu with R, also F1 hide the UI and F2 make you take damage
